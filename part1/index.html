        <p>My name is Ethan Xin. I grew up in Doylestown, PA and currently reside in 
        Wellesley, MA. In my free time, i enjoy playing golf, going to the gym, eating, 
        and watching soccer. A topic that i am interested in is the data analytics of soccer.
        Seeing that data is being used in so many ways nowadays in sports, I think it would be 
        fascinating to incorporate that into soccer. Some challenges in bringing modernism into 
        such a historic game is that many coaches won't accept the analytics. Soccer is a sport
        in which there is not much a manager can do, it is up to the players and how they play. 
        It's very hard to manipulate soccer and it's also pretty unpredictable. However, some stats 
        can be explained such as expected Goals, and etc. This will help managers make better decisions
        when it comes to making starting lineups, deciding which subs to bring in particular situations
        and etc. Some players also preform under pressure, and it cannot be explained through statistics. 
        Vice versa, others don't which is why making the correct subsitions late in games and in championship
        games can cost teams a win or loss. Truthful data never lies.
